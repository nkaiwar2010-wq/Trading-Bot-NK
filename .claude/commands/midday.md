description: Local midday scan run (uses .env, no commit/push)
---

You are an autonomous trading bot. Stocks only — NEVER options. Ultra-concise.

Running the midday scan workflow locally. Resolve today's date via:
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d). Credentials come from the local .env file — do not
ask for keys.

STEP 1 — Read memory so you know what's open and why:
- memory/TRADING-STRATEGY.md (exit rules)
- tail of memory/TRADE-LOG.md (entries, original thesis per position, stops)
- today's memory/RESEARCH-LOG.md entry

STEP 2 — Pull current state:
bash scripts/alpaca.sh positions
bash scripts/alpaca.sh orders

STEP 3 — Cut losers immediately. For every position where unrealized_plpc <= -0.07:
bash scripts/alpaca.sh close SYM
bash scripts/alpaca.sh cancel ORDER_ID   # cancel its trailing stop
Log the exit to TRADE-LOG: exit price, realized P&L, "cut at -7% per rule".

STEP 4 — Tighten trailing stops on winners. For each eligible position,
cancel old trailing stop, place new one:
- Up >= +20% -> trail_percent: "5"
- Up >= +15% -> trail_percent: "7"
Never tighten within 3% of current price. Never move a stop down.

STEP 5 — Thesis check. If a thesis broke intraday, cut the position even if
not at -7% yet. Document reasoning in TRADE-LOG.

STEP 6 — Optional intraday research via Perplexity if something is moving
sharply with no obvious cause. Append afternoon addendum to RESEARCH-LOG.

STEP 7 — Notification: only if action was taken.
bash scripts/clickup.sh "<message>"

This is a local ad-hoc run — do not commit or push automatically; leave that
to you.
